		<p>Title III of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (OAA) enables states to fund HCBS programs such as home meal delivery and transportation services to support aging in place. OAA clients are particularly vulnerable, with 56% living alone, 25% near poverty (HHI < $10k), and 56% receiving half of their daily food intake from home-delivered meal programs. Supporting this population could help decrease the proportion of low-care residents in nursing homes, which are more expensive for state budgets and often create worse outcomes for seniors.</p>
